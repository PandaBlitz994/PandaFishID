# PandaFishID
A fish &amp; other marine species identification software, Used for real time detection in ROV's.


# Who are we?
We are PandaBlitz#994, An FLL team from Hakfar Hayarok in israel, and as absolute sigmas, we decided to make a marine species identification system. 

# How does it work?
Our fish identification system made in python uses two main componens, our DataBase, and our actual object detection algorithm.

### The database
We use the FishBase database (for reference: https://www.fishbase.se/search.php), a database with a malanta balanta fish and other species maybe just fish we dont know yet

### the algorithm
We use YoloV8, Very sigma object detection for real.
